# 🧠 AI/ML Engineering Platform

## Overview

This repository serves as a foundation for building, training, deploying, and maintaining AI/ML models at scale. It integrates modern machine learning workflows with robust backend engineering practices to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency in production environments.

## 🔍 Features

### 🧠 Machine Learning Core
- Data preprocessing pipelines (ETL)
- Feature engineering modules
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Hyperparameter optimization (Optuna, Ray Tune, etc.)
- Model versioning and registry integration

### 🖥️ AI/ML Backend Infrastructure
- RESTful APIs for model serving (`FastAPI`, `Flask`)
- Model deployment support (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure)
- CI/CD pipelines for model updates
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- Logging, monitoring, and alerting (`Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `ELK` stack)
